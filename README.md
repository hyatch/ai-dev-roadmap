# ai-dev-roadmap
HiðŸ‘‹! My name is Ethan Huang, AI @ UCSD 2028. I enjoy learning about developments in the AI scene in many aspects. In my free time, I like playing fantasy football, Teamfight Tactics, and finding new cafes. 

This repo is to help myself and possibly others keep track of the progress I've made so far.
