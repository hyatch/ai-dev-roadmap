# Materials Analyzer Project 

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Fine-tune a YOLO-v8 model to detect and classify different types of material defects. Deploy the model on Streamlit. 

## ðŸ›  Stack
- Python
- Tensorflow Preprocessing
- Streamlit

## âœ… Progress
- [x] Build UI
- [x] Parse XML annotations into txt
- [x] Load and Train initial YOLO model
- [ ] Achieve 70% accuracy

## Future Variations
- Develop a GAN to fill in defects
